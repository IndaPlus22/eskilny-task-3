            For every direction that a piece should move in, generate an offset or a set of offsets for that direction.
            Then, iterate over every direction using the function try_move (see the function for details) which returns two booleans:
                legal_move - if the move is legal; then it is added to the possible_moves vector
                engine_should_continue - bool describing if the move should cause this method to halt further movement in the same direction
            So, we iterate over each offset in every direction until we reach a point where engine_should_continue is false, and then we change direction.

            Note that the pawn implementation is hacked! Pawns do not work the same way, but their behavior abides to the checks performed by the above booleans.
            See their specific implementation for details.

                    The first option isn't relevant for pawns, and the second the method try_move thinks is legal but actually isn't, since pawns can't capture forward.
